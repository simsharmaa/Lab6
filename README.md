# Lab6
For this lab, we asked the user for their name and age. and then produced a sentence that says their name and age. 

##LICENSE.md
We also have a file called license.md which includes the license terms and conditions under which a software project is distributed. We choose the MIT license. The MIT licenses are more permissive then the GPL which basically say “do whatever you want to do, just don’t sue me” 

##CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md
This code-of-conduct.md is a document that outlines the expectations for behavior and interaction within a project. We choose the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct. The code of conduct tells us to be respectful, communicate clearly, be open to feedback, and follow the guidelines. We plan to spell out acceptable and unacceptable behavior as this project is for all ages and cursing should be kept at a minimum. If something goes wrong, the offending party will apologize, and impolite in this conduct is a statement of the values of the project community.
